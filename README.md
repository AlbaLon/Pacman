## **Description:**
Pac-Man Arrangement (1996) is an arcade video game belonging to the labyrinth genre. It was released as a commemorative game of Namco's greatest hits within a compilation of these called 'Namco Classic Collection Volume 2'.

The objective of the game, as in the original Pac-Man of 1980, is still to control Pac-Man, a yellow sphere with a mouth and eyes so that he eats all the 'pac-dots' that are on the stage, however , in this installment there are many new changes, such as the implementation of a fifth ghost that merges with the four existing ones, new mechanics such as the dash or the jump or that only 23 levels instead of 255 or the presence of a final boss !!
